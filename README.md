# Color Cover

Create card covers quickly, for Trello or whatever.

## Workflow

- `title` and `subtitle` are input fields. Just enter whatever.
- As is the `icon`. the "neutral face" is just a placeholder. insert any utf-8 char. for reference, see [here](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html).
- Change the cards background by clicking one of the colors in the palette below (or change it to whatever with the dev tools).
- In Chrome, open the dev tools, inspect the `#cover` element, open command palette with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>, search "screenshot" and finally select "Capture node screenshot".
